# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of MicroViolin.js pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- Age
- Body size
- Disability
- Ethnicity
- Gender identity and expression
- Level of experience
- Nationality
- Personal appearance
- Race
- Religion
- Sexual identity and orientation
- The size of their problems (though we may judge silently)

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment:

✅ Using welcoming and inclusive language
✅ Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
✅ Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
✅ Focusing on what is best for the community
✅ Showing empathy towards other community members
✅ Appreciating the irony of having a Code of Conduct for a sarcasm library
✅ Recognizing that we're all just trying to survive in this digital age
✅ Laughing at ourselves and our first-world problems

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

❌ Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
❌ Public or private harassment
❌ Publishing others' private information without permission
❌ Taking the tiny violin seriously (it's satire, folks)
❌ Actual cyberbullying (we're joking about first-world problems, not real ones)
❌ Complaining about your Wi-Fi being only 4 bars (oh wait, that's our target audience)
❌ Suggesting we make the violin bigger
❌ Removing Comic Sans MS from the codebase
❌ Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope of "First-World Problems"

This project is designed to provide humorous perspective on **trivial inconveniences**, not to mock:

- Actual medical conditions
- Mental health struggles
- Genuine hardships
- Systemic inequalities
- Real suffering of any kind

**Examples of appropriate targets:**
- "My phone is at 47% battery" ✅
- "My latte has too much foam" ✅
- "I have to attend 3 Zoom meetings today" ✅

**Inappropriate targets:**
- Genuine health issues ❌
- Financial hardship ❌
- Grief or loss ❌
- Discrimination or injustice ❌

If you're unsure whether something is appropriate, ask yourself: "Would a reasonable person consider this a trivial inconvenience or a legitimate concern?" If the latter, it's not appropriate for this project.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to:
- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct
- Ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful
- Show you an appropriately-sized violin if you violate these guidelines

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:
- Opening an issue (for public matters)
- Contacting the project team at conduct@microviolinjs.com
- Sending a carrier pigeon (not recommended)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction
**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning with clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

*Plus you'll be shown a tiny violin.*

#### 2. Warning
**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

*Plus you'll be shown a slightly larger tiny violin (but still appropriately tiny).*

#### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

*Plus you'll be sent a compilation video of tiny violins.*

#### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

*Plus we'll create a custom violin meme just for you (but you won't get to see it because you're banned).*

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, with additional humor and violin-related modifications.

## The Bottom Line

Remember: We're all here because we think first-world problems are funny. Let's keep it light, keep it respectful, and keep it focused on the absurdity of complaining about trivial inconveniences.

If someone is genuinely suffering, they don't need a tiny violin—they need compassion and support. This project is about perspective, not cruelty.

**Be excellent to each other.** 🎻
