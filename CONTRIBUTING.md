## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a Code of Conduct (see [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Violations will be met with an appropriately-sized violin.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? That's ironic, since bugs are exactly the kind of thing that should trigger our sad trombone feature.

**Before submitting a bug report:**
1. Check if your "bug" is actually just JavaScript being JavaScript
2. Verify you're not running Internet Explorer 6
3. Ensure the universe hasn't fundamentally changed since you last checked

**When submitting a bug report, include:**
- Clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce (be specific)
- Expected behavior vs. actual behavior
- Screenshots of violins (if applicable)
- Your emotional state at the time of discovery

### Suggesting Features

Have an idea for a new feature? We'd love to hear it! Unless it's:
- Adding actual sympathy (out of scope)
- Making the violin bigger (defeats the purpose)
- Removing sarcasm (absolutely not)

### Adding Violin Memes

This is the most valuable contribution you can make!

1. Find a high-quality tiny violin meme/GIF
2. Ensure it's appropriately tiny
3. Verify it conveys the right amount of "sympathy"
4. Add the URL to the `violinMemes` array in `MicroViolin.js`
5. Test that it displays correctly
6. Submit a PR with the title: "Added violin #[number]"

**Violin Quality Guidelines:**
- ✅ Must feature a violin (or violin-adjacent instrument)
- ✅ Should be small or convey smallness
- ✅ Bonus points for sarcasm
- ✅ Extra bonus points for Comic Sans
- ❌ No actual sympathy
- ❌ No realistic human suffering
- ❌ No cellos (too big)

### Improving Documentation

Think our documentation needs work? You're probably right! We wrote it while experiencing several first-world problems.

Areas that could use improvement:
- Typos (we're sure there are many)
- Clarity (what even is clarity?)
- Examples (more sarcastic examples)
- Translations (for international first-world problems)

## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript Style

We follow a strict coding style because we're professionals:

1. **Indentation:** 4 spaces (fight us)
2. **Quotes:** Single quotes for strings (unless you have a good reason)
3. **Semicolons:** Always. This isn't Python.
4. **Comments:** Sarcastic but informative
5. **Variable names:** camelCase (we're not barbarians)
6. **Function names:** Descriptive but not verbose

**Example:**
```javascript
// Good
function deploySympath(containerId) {
    const violin = getRandomViolin();
    displayViolin(containerId, violin);
}

// Bad
function x(y) {
    var z = a();
    b(y, z);
}
```

### HTML/CSS Style

- Use semantic HTML (because we're not monsters)
- CSS should be inline in the HTML file (yes, we know)
- Comic Sans MS usage is mandatory for violin captions
- Gradients everywhere (this is the way)

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow a strict commit message format:

```
type: Brief description

Longer description if needed.

Fixes #issue-number
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature (new violin meme)
- `fix`: Bug fix (violin not displaying)
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (no functional changes)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests (just kidding, we don't have tests)
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat: Added violin meme #47

Added a new GIF of a tiny violin being played by a hamster.
This significantly improves our sympathy delivery capabilities.

Fixes #123
```

```
fix: Sad trombone not playing on console.warn

The audio wasn't triggering for console warnings.
Now ALL your problems will be properly acknowledged.

Fixes #456
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our style guidelines
3. **Test your changes** (open it in a browser, make sure it works)
4. **Update documentation** if you've added features
5. **Write a clear PR description** explaining what you did and why
6. **Wait for review** (we promise to be constructively sarcastic)

**PR Title Format:**
```
[Type] Brief description
```

**Examples:**
- `[Feature] Added 5 new violin memes`

- `[Docs] Updated README with better examples`

### Code Review Process

We review PRs regularly (when we remember to check GitHub). Here's what we look for:

✅ **Will Accept:**
- High-quality violin memes
- Bug fixes that actually fix bugs
- Documentation improvements
- Appropriate levels of sarcasm

❌ **Will Reject:**
- Adding actual sympathy
- Making violins bigger
- Removing Comic Sans MS
- Reducing sarcasm levels
- Breaking changes without discussion

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MicroViolin.git
cd MicroViolin
```

2. That's it. There's no build process. It's pure vanilla JavaScript.

3. Open `index.html` in your browser

4. Make changes and refresh

5. Marvel at your contributions to internet culture

## Testing

We have a comprehensive testing strategy:

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Does it work?
3. If yes: ✅
4. If no: Fix it and repeat

**Advanced Testing:**
```javascript
// Open browser console and run:
MicroViolin.show('main-sympathy-container');
console.error('Test error');
console.warn('Test warning');
```

If violins appear and sad trombones play, you're good to go!
